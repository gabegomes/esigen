# Supporting information generator

Automatically generate supporting information documents for your Chemistry publications.

Inspired by [Chauncey Garrett's collection of scripts](https://github.com/chauncey-garrett/gaussian-tools), this is a Python-only attempt at solving the same problem. It will also render high-quality images of the compounds via PyMol. 

A Flask/JS based web GUI is included and can be run with `runserver.py`. All dependencies are specified in a Conda `environment.yml` file.

An online demo is available @ http://supporting.herokuapp.com.
